      Compound III is a refined version of the protocol that prioritizes
      security, capital efficiency, and user experience. Its design focuses on
      simplification rather than complexity, resulting in the most effective
      borrowing tool in DeFi.


      The most significant improvement was moving away from the pooled-risk
      model, which allowed users to borrow any asset but constantly
      rehypothecated collateral. This model was vulnerable to a single bad asset
      or oracle update draining all assets from the protocol.


      In Compound III, each market deployment offers a single borrowable asset,
      and the supplied collateral remains the property of the borrower, except
      during liquidation. This new approach increases capital efficiency and
      reduces risk since the collateral is more "useful" when the borrower knows
      the specific asset being borrowed in advance.


      The first release of Compound III allows borrowing of USDC using ETH,
      WBTC, LINK, UNI, and COMP as collateral. Although borrowers will not earn
      interest on their collateral, they will be able to borrow more with lower
      risks of liquidation and penalties while spending less on gas fees.


      The repository uses a business source license 94, which Compound
      governance can grant usage to, as it sees fit.

      ## New Features of Compound V3

      The major changes to the existing protocol in Compound III can be
      summarized as follows:


      1. Each Compound III deployment features a single interest-earning base
      asset, with all other assets serving as collateral. This simplifies the
      protocol, reduces risk, and potentially improves capital efficiency.

      2. Collateral size limits, or supply caps, can be set for each collateral
      asset.

      3. Borrowing collateral factors and liquidation collateral factors are
      separate, protecting borrowers from early liquidation and improving risk
      management.

      4. The risk management and liquidation engine has been redesigned to
      increase the safety of the protocol while maintaining liquidator
      incentives.

      5. The price feed is designed to use Chainlink directly, without requiring
      a custom price oracle, making it portable to EVM chains beyond Ethereum.
      Governance retains the ability to modify this decision in the future.

      6. Supply and borrow interest rate models can be decoupled, giving
      governance full control over economic policy.

      7. Advanced account management tools enable new user experience patterns
      and applications to be built on top of the protocol.

      8. An abstract incentive metric is natively built into the core contract
      to reward user activity from the protocol's inception. A rewards system is
      also added on top to provide flexible incentives that can be extended by
      governance.

      9. A code repository includes sophisticated tooling for managing and
      testing deployments, based on years of experience and feedback from prior
      versions of the protocol.
