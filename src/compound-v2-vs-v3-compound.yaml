      Compound III is a streamlined version of the protocol, with an emphasis on
      security, capital efficiency, and user experience. Complexity wasn’t added
      — it was removed. What remains is the most effective tool for borrowers in
      DeFi.


      The most profound change was to move away from a pooled-risk model, where
      users can borrow any asset. In this model (which Compound pioneered)
      collateral is constantly rehypothecated. A single bad asset (or oracle
      update) can drain all assets from the protocol.


      Instead, each deployment of Compound III features a single borrowable
      asset. When you supply collateral, it remains your property. It can never
      be withdrawn by other users (except during liquidation). Capital
      efficiency increases too — collateral is more “useful” when you know which
      asset is being borrowed ahead of time.


      The first deployment of Compound III allows you to borrow USDC using ETH,
      WBTC, LINK, UNI, and COMP as collateral.


      While you won’t earn interest on collateral anymore, you’ll be able to
      borrow more; with less risk of liquidation and lower liquidation
      penalties; while spending less on gas.
