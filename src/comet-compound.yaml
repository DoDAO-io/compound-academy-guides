      ## Compound III

      Compound III is a computer program that holds a lot of money. People can
      suggest changes to how the program works, but these changes can make the
      program less secure. To make sure the program stays safe, developers need
      to write tests that check if the new code works well and doesn't have any
      weaknesses. Companies like OpenZeppelin, ChainSecurity, and Certora also
      help to make sure the program is safe.


      This guide explains how to make changes to the Compound III program
      safely. It talks about things like creating tests for the new code,
      running tests to make sure everything works, and using a tool called
      GitHub Actions to help with testing. The guide also explains how the
      program is set up, how to make changes to it, and how to make sure the
      changes are safe before they are added to the program.


      ## Architecture


      The Configurator is a special contract that manages all the settings for
      the Compound III protocol. It's important to be careful when making
      changes to the protocol, because even small changes can have big
      consequences. To make changes safely, developers need to write tests,
      scenarios, and migration scripts.


      A workflow is a set of tasks that can run automatically to check new code
      changes. GitHub Actions is a tool that can be used to run these workflows.
      Developers should make sure their code changes pass all the tests and
      checks before proposing any changes to the protocol.
