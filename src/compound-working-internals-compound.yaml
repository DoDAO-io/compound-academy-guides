      ## Compound III Protocol

      To achieve greater capital efficiency, including reduced gas costs,
      Compound III allows users to supply volatile crypto assets and borrow a
      single asset(often a stable coin). 


      This approach is in contrast to the current trend in DeFi where most
      borrowing involves supplying volatile crypto assets and borrowing a single
      borrowable base token. 


      Compound III offers more value by providing fine-grained access controls
      for managing accounts, internalizing liquidation and profits, and
      optimizing for common usage with crypto collateral and borrows.

      The most significant configuration variables for Compound III that impact
      the lend and borrow rates are as follows:


      `utilization` - The formula for producing the utilization is: `Utilization
      = TotalBorrows / TotalSupply`


      `supplyKink` - This represents the point in the supply rates where the low
      interest rate slope meets the high interest rate slope, and is measured in
      factors.


      `borrowKink` - This represents the point in the borrow rate where the low
      interest rate slope meets the high interest rate slope, and is measured in
      factors.


      `supplyPerSecondInterestRateBase` - This is the base interest rate for
      supply per second, measured in factors.


      `supplyPerSecondInterestRateSlopeLow` - This is the interest rate slope
      for supply per second when the utilization is below the kink point,
      measured in factors.


      `supplyPerSecondInterestRateSlopeHigh` - This is the interest rate slope
      for supply per second when the utilization is above the kink point,
      measured in factors.


      `borrowPerSecondInterestRateSlopeLow` - This is the interest rate slope
      for borrow per second when the utilization is below the kink point,
      measured in factors.


      `borrowPerSecondInterestRateSlopeHigh` - This is the interest rate slope
      for borrow per second when the utilization is above the kink point,
      measured in factors.


      `borrowPerSecondInterestRateBase` - This is the base interest rate for
      borrow per second, measured in factors.

      ## Interest Rate Calculations

      Following statements show how interest rates are calculated


      ### Supply Rate

      ##### when `utilization <= supplyKink`

      supply rate  =  interestRateBase + interestRateSlopeLow * utilization 


      ##### when `utilization > supplyKink`

      supply rate  =  interestRateBase + interestRateSlopeLow * kink +
      interestRateSlopeHigh * (utilization - kink)


      ### Borrow Rate

      ##### when `utilization <= borrowKink`

      borrow rate = interestRateBase + interestRateSlopeLow * utilization


      ##### when `utilization > borrowKink`

      borrow rate = interestRateBase + interestRateSlopeLow * kink +
      interestRateSlopeHigh * (utilization - kink)

      Updated recs (Option 2):

      borrowKink = 900000000000000000

      borrowPerSecondInterestRateBase = 157680000

      borrowPerSecondInterestRateSlopeHigh = 19552320000

      borrowPerSecondInterestRateSlopeLow = 1639871893


      supplyKink = 900000000000000000

      supplyPerSecondInterestRateBase = 0

      supplyPerSecondInterestRateSlopeHigh = 9460800000

      supplyPerSecondInterestRateSlopeLow = 1356048000

      ```
