      ## Lending

      Lending involves permitting an individual or organization to utilize the
      resources of the lender. The lender receives compensation for their
      contribution in the form of interest. Lending helps to prevent the
      depreciation of asset values, particularly money, over time. While the
      returns on lending to banks are stable and fixed, they are typically very
      small.


      ## Borrowing

      Borrowing involves receiving an item from another party with an agreement
      that the borrowed asset or an equivalent value will be returned at a
      specified time. The equivalent value put up against the loan is referred
      to as collateral. The objective of borrowing is to utilize an asset that
      is not currently available by providing something you already possess as
      security for repayment of the borrowed item. Obtaining a favorable loan
      offer from banks necessitates a strong credit score.


      ## Advantages of Lending and borrowing

      1. Lending and borrowing facilitate the flow of resources from the people
      with surplus resources who do not have a use for them and people without a
      particular resource in necessary amounts. This trading of time value of
      assets benefits both the parties.

      2. Lending prevents the devaluation of money held by a person by
      generating value via interests.

      3. Lending ensures the circulation of resources held in surplus which
      otherwise would be locked up with one person/ entity and unusable.

      4. Lending and borrowing play a crucial role in the ecosystem of small
      businesses. Providing them with resources they otherwise would not have to
      sustain their business initially.
