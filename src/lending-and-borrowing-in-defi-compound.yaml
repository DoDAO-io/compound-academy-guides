      ## Lending

      Lending involves permitting an individual or organization to utilize the
      resources of the lender. The lender receives compensation for their
      contribution in the form of interest. Lending helps to prevent the
      depreciation of asset values, particularly money, over time. While the
      returns on lending to banks are stable and fixed, they are typically very
      small.


      ## Borrowing

      Borrowing involves receiving an item from another party with an agreement
      that the borrowed asset or an equivalent value will be returned at a
      specified time. The equivalent value put up against the loan is referred
      to as collateral. The objective of borrowing is to utilize an asset that
      is not currently available by providing something you already possess as
      security for repayment of the borrowed item. Obtaining a favorable loan
      offer from banks necessitates a strong credit score.


      ## Advantages of Lending and borrowing

      1. Lending and borrowing facilitate the flow of resources from the people
      with surplus resources who do not have a use for them and people without a
      particular resource in necessary amounts. This trading of time value of
      assets benefits both the parties.

      2. Lending prevents the devaluation of money held by a person by
      generating value via interests.

      3. Lending ensures the circulation of resources held in surplus which
      otherwise would be locked up with one person/ entity and unusable.

      4. Lending and borrowing play a crucial role in the ecosystem of small
      businesses. Providing them with resources they otherwise would not have to
      sustain their business initially.

      The principle behind lending involves depositing money in banks, which are
      then used to provide loans to borrowers with interest rates. Lenders are
      compensated for their contribution through interest, and the difference in
      APR between lenders and borrowers is the bank's revenue.


      Lending operates on a trust-based system, calculated by FICO scores, and
      involves multiple agreements and paperwork. Loans must be repaid with
      interest within a certain period, typically ranging from one to seven
      years. Various fees may apply, including application fees, processing
      fees, origination fees, annual fees, late fees, and prepayment fees.


      Lending is heavily regulated, with regulatory bodies in place to protect
      consumers and stakeholders. Accountability is ensured, with assets
      unlikely to be locked without return. Banks also have well-developed
      supply chains, providing accessibility.


      However, there are also several disadvantages to lending. Banks spend
      significant amounts on fancy buildings and offices, and the workforce can
      be prone to inefficiency and burnout. The loan process can also be
      time-consuming, with a lot of paperwork involved.


      Transparency and returns are also issues. Banks do not disclose their
      profits and margins to the public, and the returns offered to lenders can
      be lower than other investment opportunities, potentially problematic
      given the higher profit margins for banks. Banks also run on marginal
      reserves, and if the banks go bankrupt, the governments often interfere
      and use tax payers money to try to handle the situation.Furthermore, the
      banking sector has lacked innovation, operating on the same principles for
      the last decade or so.

      Similar to individuals, a smart contract in blockchain has a unique wallet
      address that serves as an account number. Lenders can send funds to the
      smart contract address, and borrowers can obtain loans from this address,
      provided they meet the conditions encoded in the smart contract. DeFi
      eliminates the need for a bank intermediary, as the lending and borrowing
      transactions are executed through the application code. The conditions for
      loan approval are strictly based on the rules set by the smart contract,
      independent of the borrower's identity. All lenders and borrowers are
      recorded on the blockchain, as are all transactions and associated fees.


      Trust is unnecessary in DeFi since all smart contract rules are publicly
      accessible, and anyone can verify positions, transactions, and fees.
      Additionally, any profits or losses generated by DeFi lending and
      borrowing applications are available in real-time on the blockchain.



      ## Working

      A "liquidity pool(s)" is maintained by the protocol, where the assets
      (liquidity) of all lenders are combined. These pools may either be
      singular for the entire platform or divided based on asset types or other
      strategies. 


      Borrowers request loans by providing collateral, with loans in DeFi
      usually being over collateralized. The platform ensures that the
      borrower's position remains healthy at all times. If the value of the
      collateral provided by the borrower falls below a certain threshold, the
      loan is liquidated, and the liquidated funds are sold to independent
      liquidators at a discounted price to guarantee immediate settlement. 


      Transaction fees and liquidation fees may be added by the platform if the
      loan is liquidated. After any platform fees or interest deductions, the
      interest gained from borrowers is paid to the lenders. Platform fees are
      often quite low due to competition and transparency. In order to promote a
      particular side or the overall growth of the platform, the platform may
      choose to incentivize lenders, borrowers, or both.

      One of the key benefits of using DeFi lending and borrowing is the speed
      at which transactions can be carried out. Since the lending and borrowing
      rules are encoded into a Smart Contract using blockchain technology, there
      is no need for human interaction, and actions can be executed instantly.
      Furthermore, all DeFi platforms operate 24/7, making their services
      readily accessible.


      DeFi lending and borrowing also offers an open system, which eliminates
      the need for extensive assessments, paperwork, and other time-consuming
      procedures typically associated with loan applications. All that is
      required is a crypto wallet.


      Another significant advantage of DeFi lending and borrowing is the
      immutability of blockchain technology. Because it is decentralized, data
      stored on the blockchain cannot be tampered with, resulting in full
      verifiability and reliability.
