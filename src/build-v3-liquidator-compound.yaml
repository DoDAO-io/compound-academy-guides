      ## Liquidation

      Liquidation refers to the process of seizing and selling collateral in
      DeFi lending and borrowing platforms when its value drops below a specific
      threshold known as the liquidation ratio. 


      This ratio is set by the lending platform to ensure that there is enough
      collateral to cover the outstanding loan, and it represents the minimum
      ratio of the collateral's value to the loan value. To avoid liquidation,
      borrowers must usually provide collateral that exceeds the loan amount,
      which is called over-collateralization. 


      The degree of over-collateralization required varies depending on the
      lending platform and the cryptocurrency used as collateral.
      Over-collateralization helps to mitigate the risk of default or a decrease
      in collateral value, ensuring there is enough collateral to cover
      outstanding debt and minimizing risk for lenders and the lending platform.


      ## Liquidation Process

      When a borrower places cryptocurrency as collateral and borrows another
      cryptocurrency, the lending platform constantly monitors the value of the
      collateral. If the value falls below the liquidation ratio, the loan is
      considered undercollateralized, and liquidation can occur.


      The liquidation process involves a liquidator purchasing the collateral at
      a discounted price to cover the outstanding loan. The liquidator receives
      a discount on the collateral to compensate for the risk they are taking
      on. The discount is determined by the lending platform and is designed to
      incentivize liquidators to participate in the liquidation process.


      The proceeds from the sale of the collateral are then used to repay the
      outstanding loan. If the proceeds are greater than the outstanding loan,
      the excess is returned to the borrower. However, if the proceeds are not
      enough to cover the outstanding loan, the borrower is responsible for the
      difference. In some cases, the lending platform may absorb some of the
      losses.


      It's important for borrowers to be aware of the liquidation process and
      the risks involved. They should also make sure to maintain their
      collateral above the liquidation ratio to avoid liquidation. On the other
      hand, liquidators can benefit from the discounted collateral prices, but
      they also take on the risk of the collateral value decreasing further
      after the purchase. Overall, the liquidation process is designed to
      protect the lending platform and its users from significant losses due to
      undercollateralized loans.

      ## Changes to the liquidation system in Compound III

      The latest version of the Compound protocol has undergone changes in its
      liquidation system. To ensure the system's solvency, the protocol takes
      over borrower accounts that violate the collateral requirements.
      Underwater borrowers are repaid using the protocol's reserves. However, if
      the protocol reserves fall below a governance-selected threshold, anyone
      can extract value after the account is absorbed.


      ## Liquidation criteria in Compound III

      Like other DeFi projects, Compound III demands that borrowers maintain a
      greater value of collateral locked in the protocol than the total value of
      their borrow at all times, a process called over-collateralization. When a
      borrower accrues excessive interest on their borrow, or the USD value of
      their collateral decreases too much, or the USD value of their borrow
      rises too much, the account becomes liquidatable.


      ## Incentives for liquidators in Compound III

      During the liquidation process, any account can extract value through an
      arbitrage opportunity. When the protocol absorbs an account, it repays its
      open borrow of the base asset using the protocol reserves and seizes the
      entire collateral assets of the account. Using the protocol's price feed,
      the seized collateral's discounted price is determined and then publicly
      sold. Any account can purchase the discounted collateral using the base
      asset. A liquidator can purchase the discounted collateral asset, trade it
      on a DEX at a higher price, and earn the difference in a single EVM
      transaction.


      ## Blockchains for Liquidation

      Liquidations can occur on any blockchain where Compound III is deployed,
      and the protocol is written in Solidity and can be deployed to any EVM
      chain that has a price feed, sufficient liquidity, and a means for
      on-chain governance. However, running the liquidator bot contract example
      in the Comet repository is not recommended as it only serves as an
      educational tool, and running it may result in reverted transactions and
      EVM gas wasted as a result of losing the battle to better running
      searchers.

      Liquidation is determined based on liquidation collateral factors, which
      are distinct and higher than borrow collateral factors used for
      determining initial borrowing capacity. This mechanism safeguards both
      borrowers and the protocol by ensuring a price buffer for all new
      positions. Additionally, this system enables governance to decrease borrow
      collateral factors without initiating the liquidation of existing
      positions.


      When an account's borrowing balance surpasses the limits set by
      liquidation collateral factors, it becomes qualified for liquidation. The
      absorb function can be activated by a liquidator (a bot, contract, or
      user), which transfers ownership of the account's collateral and refunds
      the user the value of the collateral minus a penalty (liquidationFactor)
      in the base asset. Following liquidation, the user has no outstanding debt
      and will usually have an excess balance of the base asset, which can earn
      interest.


      The protocol's reserves of the base asset fund each absorption. In
      exchange, the protocol gains ownership of the collateral assets. If the
      remaining reserves are lower than a governance-set target, liquidators can
      purchase the collateral at a discount using the base asset, which boosts
      the protocol's reserves of the base asset.

      This is an example of how Compound III handles liquidations


      1. If a borrower doesn't have enough collateral to cover their loan or the
      value of their collateral drops too much, their account can be liquidated.
      This can be checked at any time programmatically using the Comet
      `isLiquidatable` function, which returns a boolean.


      2. A person who notices the liquidation creates a transaction to make
      money through arbitrage.


      3. The first step in the process is for the protocol to move the
      borrower's collateral to the protocol balance sheet to cover the loan.
      This is done by invoking the `absorb` function on the Comet smart
      contract. 


      4. The absorb function guarantees that the current reserves value is lower
      than targetReserves. Once targetReserves is achieved, the v3 contracts
      retain the collateral assets and provide compensation to the liquidator
      through rewards. However, reaching the high value of targetReserves is
      unlikely.


      4. The person then figures out how much of the borrower's collateral they
      can buy with the base asset. To ascertain the payment for the base asset,
      the searcher should inspect the `collateralBalanceOf` for each associated
      collateral asset. After obtaining the asset's price through the price
      feed, they can utilize the `quoteCollateral` function to determine the
      discounted rate.


      5. They can pay for this with their own money or by using another protocol
      to borrow the base asset. This can be done by calling `buyCollateral` to
      purchase as much of the discounted collateral as they can.


      6. Once they have the collateral, they can sell it at a higher price on a
      DEX like Uniswap.


      7. They use the profits to repay any borrowed base asset and keep the
      remaining balance for themselves.
