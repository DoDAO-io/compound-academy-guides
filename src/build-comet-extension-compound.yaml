      Compound III, has launched a new feature called "Extensions". This feature
      is designed to allow community developers to create optional add-ons that
      can be used to enhance the Compound experience for users.


      When a user enables an extension, it can leverage Compound III's advanced
      account management functionality to add new features to their account.
      These can include automation, position management, and composability with
      other DeFi protocols. Alternatively, an extension can run without
      requiring any permissions and simply provide useful information like
      liquidation alerts.


      There are two types of extensions: 

      1. Web Extensions - Web extensions are like mini-websites that are
      embedded into the Compound III interface, allowing users to interact with
      the platform in new and different ways 

      2. Operators - Operators, on the other hand, are smart contracts that
      allow users to do things like move positions from other DeFi platforms to
      Compound III. 


      Some extensions have both a web extension and an operator, while others
      have only one or the other.


      At launch, there are four extensions available to users:


      1. Advanced Transactions – This extension allows users to bundle multiple
      actions into a single transaction.

      2. Position Migrator – This extension enables users to import positions
      from Compound v2 and Aave v2 into their Compound III balance.

      3. DeFi Saver – This extension adds sophisticated tools to manage a user's
      Compound III position.

      4. Comp.Vote – This extension provides a gas-free voting experience.


      However, these four extensions are just the beginning. There are dozens of
      other extensions waiting to be developed, limited only by the creativity
      of community developers. 


      Each extension runs inside the Compound interface in a sandboxed iframe.
      The Extension Repo contains the base code for implementing an extension,
      as well as a curated list of available extensions. Currently, there are no
      set standards for including an extension in the Compound interface. The
      community is expected to help develop guidelines for approving or
      accepting new extensions, including security audit requirements for new
      contracts.
