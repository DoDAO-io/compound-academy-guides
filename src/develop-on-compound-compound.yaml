      ## Compound III

      Compound III is a specialized protocol that aims to achieve greater
      capital efficiency in DeFi by allowing users to supply volatile assets and
      borrow a single stable asset. This approach is intended to reduce gas
      costs and increase capital efficiency. The Compound III Smart Contracts or
      Coment repository uses a business source license, which Compound
      governance can grant usage to, as it sees fit, by making changes to
      compound-community-licenses.eth, a new ENS domain owned by the community.


      ## Compound Grants Program (CGP)

      Compound is encouraging developers to collaborate and build on top of the
      new Compound III code base through the Compound Grants Program. This
      program is designed to promote composability and facilitate the
      development of new features and functionality related to Compound III. The
      primary objectives of the program are to expand Compound's grant program,
      delegate capital allocation to members of the community, and strengthen
      the builder community during bear market conditions.


      ## CGP 2.0 Details

      CGP 2.0 is a specific program within the Compound Grants Program that
      focuses on getting the community to participate in the process of
      delegating capital allocation. The program disburses $800K (22087.24 COMP)
      through 4 domain allocators, who are experts in their specific domains and
      involved in the Compound community. Each domain allocator runs their
      respective grants program on-chain for full transparency using Questbook.
      The disbursement of the grant happens on-chain from a multi-sig wallet
      controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The program
      manager will coordinate with the compound community to ensure that the
      application is aligned with the Compound growth before signing the
      disbursal, while the domain allocator approves or rejects the application
      based on their evaluation.
