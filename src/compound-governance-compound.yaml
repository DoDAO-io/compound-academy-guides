      The goal of Compound is to create a sturdy financial infrastructure for
      developers and applications to rely on. To achieve this, the Compound
      protocol must be fully decentralized, eliminating the risk of a single
      point of failure (the team) and creating a robust, unbreakable system that
      can grow in new directions. The Compound protocol has established a
      governance structure that enables voters to make changes to the protocol
      through proposals, discussions, and executions, all without relying on or
      requiring the involvement of the team. Community governance takes the lead
      in this system as the administrator of the Compound protocol.


      With the help of the COMP token, governance module (Governor Bravo), and
      Timelock, COMP token-holders govern and upgrade the Compound protocol.
      These three components work together to provide the community with the
      ability to propose, vote, and implement changes through the cToken's
      administrative functions or the Comptroller. These proposals can change
      system parameters, introduce new markets, or add new features to the
      protocol.


      This system guarantees that the Compound protocol remains adaptive to the
      needs of its users and gives every COMP token holder a voice in
      determining the direction of the platform. If you are seeking a lending
      platform that places control in your hands, Compound is the perfect choice
      for you.



      This "Compound Governance" guide serves as a comprehensive guide for those
      who want to contribute to the Compound DAO.  This document outlines the
      different responsibilities, procedures, and opportunities for all parties
      involved in the Compound DAO. It brings together essential information in
      a single, easy-to-use source.

      ## Compound Governor Proposals

      Compound Governor Proposals are utilized to authorize various executions
      of smart contracts, such as the adjustment of risk parameters,
      distribution parameters, primary modular contracts, and administrative
      functions (such as reducing reserves or transferring ERC-20 tokens).


      The lifecycle of a Compound Governor Proposal involves three stages:


      1. Idea stage: Post the proposal in the "Proposal" category on the
      Compound Forum and provide enough information to demonstrate its impact on
      Compound.

      2. Community Feedback stage: Use the community's feedback to make any
      necessary changes to the proposal.

      3. Compound Governor stage: After the proposal is approved by the
      community and has a high chance of success, it is recommended to move it
      to an on-chain vote.


      Any individual with more than 1% of COMP can propose a proposal to
      Compound Governance. If they don't have enough COMP, they can request
      someone else to post the proposal on their behalf. The Compound multisig
      can also temporarily white-list proposers.


      ## Compound Improvement Proposals

      The Compound Improvement Proposals (CIPs) outline the standards,
      procedures, and upgrades aimed at enhancing the governance protocol. Their
      objective is to refine both on-chain and off-chain governance of the
      Compound.


      CIPs come in three different forms, each with its distinct methodology,
      which are detailed below.


      1. Meta Process: Any process to be introduced or altered that enhances the
      coordination of Compound's governance, development, or community
      initiatives.

      2. Protocol Enhancement: This encompasses any alterations to the smart
      contracts involved in the Compound Protocol and Governor.

      3. Tooling & Support: This encompasses any new additions or modifications
      to off-chain infrastructure, tools, documentation, or other supportive
      components for the use of Compound Protocol.

      The authors of CIPs will initiate the process by conceiving an idea,
      converting it into a CIP document, seeking a peer review, and then
      undergoing an approval procedure with the Compound Working Group.


      To initiate a review, the CIP document should be posted in the #governance
      channel on Compound's Discord platform.


      Potential ideas can be submitted as issues on a shared GitHub repository,
      similar to Ethereum PM. CIPs can be drafted as pull requests and then
      request for a review to be scheduled for discussion at the bi-weekly
      Working Group meetings.


      ![](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/compound-eth-1/Guide/compound-governance-compound/cip_appproval_process.png)



      CIP editors will provide feedback on CIPs. If objections are raised during
      its first meeting, the CIP must address the feedback and request another
      review at a future meeting. If there are no objections or a majority of
      editors support the CIP, it will be approved during its second meeting and
      remain in the Last Call stage for 14 days before the implementation
      process commences.


      ![](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/compound-eth-1/Guide/compound-governance-compound/cip_implementation_process.png)



      Once the Working Group approves a CIP, its implementation path will vary
      based on its type:


      1. Meta Process CIPs will be adopted officially through a majority Signal
      vote by COMP holders without the need for a quorum.

      2. Protocol Enhancements must pass through a Compound Governance vote,
      just like any other change to the smart contract.

      3. Other CIPs are left to the community to implement, which may include
      funding approved by a Grant Committee or any other entity willing to
      support them.

      There are three main roles in the Compound governance process:


      ### Delegates

      Delegates have acquired voting power through delegation from other
      community members or self-delegation. The addresses are ranked by voting
      weight and only the top 100 delegates are displayed. Any individual
      holding more than 1% of COMP is eligible to propose a governance action.


      Becoming a delegate is open to everyone and does not require any
      applications. Delegates can access their voting history by visiting their
      profile.


      ### Delegators

      Delegators are community members who own COMP but have assigned their
      voting power to another individual, referred to as a delegate.


      ### Contributors

      Contributors are members of the Compound DAO who actively contribute their
      time and effort to the organization. They participate by developing on top
      of the Compound Protocol or supporting the DAO through grants or
      partnerships, all while working towards common goals.



      In Compound DAO, there are no established working groups, and no templates
      exist for creating such groups. Compound DAO has entered into service
      provider agreements with Open Zeppelin and Gauntlet.


      To streamline the process for individuals or teams to participate in the
      DAO, a standardized "Service Provider" template should be established.

      Compound DAO has two sources of funding:


      ### 1. Direct funding through governance

      - Service providers can enter into agreements with Compound DAO in
      exchange for payment. This option is currently not frequently used within
      Compound DAO, but it may become more prevalent in the future as service
      providers become more common.

      - Open Zeppelin serves as an example of a service provider for Compound
      DAO.


      ### 2. Compound Grants Program 2.0

      - The Compound Grants Program focuses on four areas: Multichain strategy,
      Developer Tooling, Security Tooling, and New Protocol Ideas & Dapps.
      Applicants can apply directly for funding through the program.

      - If your proposal does not fall within the specified domains, or if you
      have any questions about the grants program, please reach out to the team
      in the #grants channel on the Compound Discord.

      All protocol modifications in Compound DAO are executed through Compound
      Governor. Proposals are actual executable code, not just suggestions for
      the team or foundation to execute.


      After a proposal has been submitted, it goes through a 3-day voting
      period. For a proposal to be approved, it must receive a minimum of
      400,000 votes and achieve a majority. Once the proposal has been approved,
      it is immediately scheduled in the timelock and will be put into effect
      after a 2-day waiting period.
