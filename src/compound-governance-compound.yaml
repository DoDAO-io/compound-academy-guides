      ## Compound Governor Proposals

      Compound Governor Proposals are utilized to authorize various executions
      of smart contracts, such as the adjustment of risk parameters,
      distribution parameters, primary modular contracts, and administrative
      functions (such as reducing reserves or transferring ERC-20 tokens).


      The lifecycle of a Compound Governor Proposal involves three stages:


      1. Idea stage: Post the proposal in the "Proposal" category on the
      Compound Forum and provide enough information to demonstrate its impact on
      Compound.

      2. Community Feedback stage: Use the community's feedback to make any
      necessary changes to the proposal.

      3. Compound Governor stage: After the proposal is approved by the
      community and has a high chance of success, it is recommended to move it
      to an on-chain vote.


      Any individual with more than 1% of COMP can propose a proposal to
      Compound Governance. If they don't have enough COMP, they can request
      someone else to post the proposal on their behalf. The Compound multisig
      can also temporarily white-list proposers.


      ## Compound Improvement Proposals

      The Compound Improvement Proposals (CIPs) outline the standards,
      procedures, and upgrades aimed at enhancing the governance protocol. Their
      objective is to refine both on-chain and off-chain governance of the
      Compound.


      CIPs come in three different forms, each with its distinct methodology,
      which are detailed below.


      1. Meta Process: Any process to be introduced or altered that enhances the
      coordination of Compound's governance, development, or community
      initiatives.

      2. Protocol Enhancement: This encompasses any alterations to the smart
      contracts involved in the Compound Protocol and Governor.

      3. Tooling & Support: This encompasses any new additions or modifications
      to off-chain infrastructure, tools, documentation, or other supportive
      components for the use of Compound Protocol.

      Once a CIP is approved by the Working Group, the implementation process
      will vary depending on its type:

      1. Meta Process: Any process to be implemented or modified that better
      coordinates Compounds governance, development, or community efforts.

      2. Protocol Enhancement: This involves any changes to smart contracts that
      are involved in Compound Protocol and Governor

      3. Tooling & Support: This involves any additions or modifications to
      off-chain infrastructure, tooling, documentation, or other components that
      support the usage of Compound Protocol.
