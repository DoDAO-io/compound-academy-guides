      "content": "## Extensions\nCompound III, has launched a new feature called \"Extensions\". This feature is designed to allow community developers to create optional add-ons that can be used to enhance the Compound experience for users.\n\nWhen a user enables an extension, it can leverage Compound III's advanced account management functionality to add new features to their account. These can include automation, position management, and composability with other DeFi protocols. Alternatively, an extension can run without requiring any permissions and simply provide useful information like liquidation alerts.\n\n## Extension Types\nThere are two types of extensions: \n1. Web Extensions - Web extensions are like mini-websites that are embedded into the Compound III interface, allowing users to interact with the platform in new and different ways \n2. Operators - Operators, on the other hand, are smart contracts that allow users to do things like move positions from other DeFi platforms to Compound III. \n\nSome extensions have both a web extension and an operator, while others have only one or the other.\n\n## Initial Extensions\nAt launch, there are four extensions available to users:\n\n1. Advanced Transactions – This extension allows users to bundle multiple actions into a single transaction.\n2. Position Migrator – This extension enables users to import positions from Compound v2 and Aave v2 into their Compound III balance.\n3. DeFi Saver – This extension adds sophisticated tools to manage a user's Compound III position.\n4. Comp.Vote – This extension provides a gas-free voting experience.\n\nHowever, these four extensions are just the beginning. There are dozens of other extensions waiting to be developed, limited only by the creativity of community developers. \n",
