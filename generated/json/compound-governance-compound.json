This document outlines the different responsibilities, procedures, and opportunities for all parties involved in the Compound DAO. It brings together essential information in a single, easy-to-use source.\n\n## Governance Process\nThe processes described in this section are an overview of the official ways to participate in Compound DAO, documenting the various paths for the lifecycle of a COMP holder, contributor or curious individual.\n\nMost governance discussions occur on the official Compound Forum and Compound\t Discord.\n\n### Proposals\nThere are 4 types of proposals.\n\n* Compound Governor Proposals\n* Compound Improvement Proposals (CIPs)\n  * Meta Process\n  * Protocol Enhancement\n  * Tooling & Support\n",

      "content": "## Compound Governor Proposals\nCompound Governor Proposals are utilized to authorize various executions of smart contracts, such as the adjustment of risk parameters, distribution parameters, primary modular contracts, and administrative functions (such as reducing reserves or transferring ERC-20 tokens).\n\nThe lifecycle of a Compound Governor Proposal involves three stages:\n\n1. Idea stage: Post the proposal in the \"Proposal\" category on the Compound Forum and provide enough information to demonstrate its impact on Compound.\n2. Community Feedback stage: Use the community's feedback to make any necessary changes to the proposal.\n3. Compound Governor stage: After the proposal is approved by the community and has a high chance of success, it is recommended to move it to an on-chain vote.\n\nAny individual with more than 1% of COMP can propose a proposal to Compound Governance. If they don't have enough COMP, they can request someone else to post the proposal on their behalf. The Compound multisig can also temporarily white-list proposers.\n\n## Compound Improvement Proposals\nThe Compound Improvement Proposals (CIPs) outline the standards, procedures, and upgrades aimed at enhancing the governance protocol. Their objective is to refine both on-chain and off-chain governance of the Compound.\n\nCIPs come in three different forms, each with its distinct methodology, which are detailed below.\n\n1. Meta Process: Any process to be introduced or altered that enhances the coordination of Compound's governance, development, or community initiatives.\n2. Protocol Enhancement: This encompasses any alterations to the smart contracts involved in the Compound Protocol and Governor.\n3. Tooling & Support: This encompasses any new additions or modifications to off-chain infrastructure, tools, documentation, or other supportive components for the use of Compound Protocol.",

      "content": "The authors of CIPs will initiate the process by conceiving an idea, converting it into a CIP document, seeking a peer review, and then undergoing an approval procedure with the Compound Working Group.\n\nTo initiate a review, the CIP document should be posted in the #governance channel on Compound's Discord platform.\n\nPotential ideas can be submitted as issues on a shared GitHub repository, similar to Ethereum PM. CIPs can be drafted as pull requests and then request for a review to be scheduled for discussion at the bi-weekly Working Group meetings.\n\nCIP editors will provide feedback on CIPs. If objections are raised during its first meeting, the CIP must address the feedback and request another review at a future meeting. If there are no objections or a majority of editors support the CIP, it will be approved during its second meeting and remain in the Last Call stage for 14 days before the implementation process commences.\n\nOnce the Working Group approves a CIP, its implementation path will vary based on its type:\n\n1. Meta Process CIPs will be adopted officially through a majority Signal vote by COMP holders without the need for a quorum.\n2. Protocol Enhancements must pass through a Compound Governance vote, just like any other change to the smart contract.\n3. Other CIPs are left to the community to implement, which may include funding approved by a Grant Committee or any other entity willing to support them.",
