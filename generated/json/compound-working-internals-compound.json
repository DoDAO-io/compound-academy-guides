      "content": "To achieve greater capital efficiency, including reduced gas costs, Compound III allows users to supply volatile crypto assets and borrow a single asset(often a stable coin). \n\nThis approach is in contrast to the current trend in DeFi where most borrowing involves supplying volatile crypto assets and borrowing a single borrowable base token. Compound III offers more value by providing fine-grained access controls for managing accounts, internalizing liquidation and profits, and optimizing for common usage with crypto collateral and borrows. \n\nInterest is earned by users who have a positive balance of the base asset, and it's denominated in the base asset. The interest rate is determined by a supply rate model, which is set by governance. On the other hand, users with a negative balance of the base asset have to pay interest based on a borrow rate model, which is also set by governance. These are two separate interest rate models.\n\nThe supply and borrow interest rates are determined by the utilization rate of the base asset. Each model has a utilization rate \"kink\" above which the interest rate increases more rapidly. Interest is calculated every second using the block timestamp. Collateral assets, however, do not earn or pay interest.\n\n",
